# Parallel-beam X-ray CT Reconstruction by Using Pixel-basis

This is a matlab implemention of the reconstruction algorithm proposed in the paper parallel-beam X-ray CT reconstruction by using pixel-basis.

## Usage
Run the test_recon.m file to test the reconstruction time, SNR and SSIM.

Run the test_backprojection.m file to test the backprojection SNR and SSIM.
