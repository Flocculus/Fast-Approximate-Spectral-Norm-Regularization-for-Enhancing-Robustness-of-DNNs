# Fast Approximate Spectral Norm Regularization for Enhancing Robustness of DNNs

This is a pytorch implemention of the fast spectral norm regularization algorithm proposed in the paper Fast Approximate Spectral Norm Regularization for Enhancing Robustness of DNNs.

## Usage

The 'GPU_version.py' will compare our fast spectral norm regularization algorithm with the newest algorithm. You can modify row 302 to switch loss among none regularizer (```loss = loss```), our regularizer (```loss = loss + loss_my_conv```) and newest regularizer (```loss = loss + loss_old_conv```).
